1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs begins with clear communication and analysis of the problem the software is meant to solve. I’ve learned that user stories help frame those needs in a way that centers the user’s goals, not just technical requirements. By using the format “As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [benefit],” I can translate abstract needs into concrete programming tasks. This clarity ensures development stays user-focused.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I now approach development iteratively by breaking projects into smaller tasks and prioritizing regular feedback. Agile practices like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives have helped me stay focused and continuously improve. I hope to incorporate backlog grooming and regular sprint reviews in future team environments, as they promote adaptability and alignment with client goals.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means actively contributing code and ideas, but also listening, collaborating, and helping remove roadblocks for others. It’s about transparency—communicating progress, owning mistakes, and delivering work on time. I’ve also learned the value of empathy and flexibility when working with others on a shared goal.
